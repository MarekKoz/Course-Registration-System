# Course Registration System

Did you ever wonder how your university's course registration system worked? This implementation attempts to recreate the system that is applied by my university. 

This program will allow students to log in, view available courses, and join or leave a course. The program also allows administrators to add or remove courses, add or remove a student from a specific course. 

Serialization is explored in order to save the changes the user makes, allowing the program to be up to date each time it is run. Operating on data from a CSV file allowed me to understand how to place data in numerous data structures and use those structures to make the program functional.
